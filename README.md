# CS231n: Deep Learning for Computer Vision - Assignment Solutions


This repository contains my solutions to the assignments of the [CS231n](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) course offered by Stanford University (Spring 2018).


Assignments using Tensorflow are completed, those using Pytorch will be implemented in the future.

### Assignment 1:
- [Q1](https://github.com/jariasf/CS231n/blob/master/assignment1/knn.ipynb): k-Nearest Neighbor classifier. (_Done_)
- [Q2](https://github.com/jariasf/CS231n/blob/master/assignment1/svm.ipynb): Training a Support Vector Machine. (_Done_)
- [Q3](https://github.com/jariasf/CS231n/blob/master/assignment1/softmax.ipynb): Implement a Softmax classifier. (_Done_)
- [Q4](https://github.com/jariasf/CS231n/blob/master/assignment1/two_layer_net.ipynb): Two-Layer Neural Network. (_Done_)
- [Q5](https://github.com/jariasf/CS231n/blob/master/assignment1/features.ipynb): Higher Level Representations: Image Features. (_Done_)

### Assignment 2:
- [Q1](https://github.com/jariasf/CS231n/blob/master/assignment2/FullyConnectedNets.ipynb): Fully-connected Neural Network. (_Done_)
- [Q2](https://github.com/jariasf/CS231n/blob/master/assignment2/BatchNormalization.ipynb): Batch Normalization. (_Done_)
- [Q3](https://github.com/jariasf/CS231n/blob/master/assignment2/Dropout.ipynb): Dropout. (_Done_)
- [Q4](https://github.com/jariasf/CS231n/blob/master/assignment2/ConvolutionalNetworks.ipynb): Convolutional Networks. (_Done_)

  
The rest of the assignments will be added in the coming days....
